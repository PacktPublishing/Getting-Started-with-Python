# Getting Started with Python
Understand key data structures and use Python in object-oriented programming

This learning path helps you get comfortable in the world of Python. It starts with a thorough and practical introduction to Python. You'll quickly start writing programs in the first part of the learning path. With the power of linked lists, binary searches, and sorting algorithms, you'll easily create complex data structures, such as graphs, stacks, and queues. After understanding cooperative inheritance, you'll expertly raise, handle, and manipulate exceptions. You will effortlessly integrate the object-oriented and not-so-object-oriented aspects of Python, and create maintainable applications using higher level design patterns. Once you've covered the core topics, youâ€™ll
understand the joy of unit testing and just how easy it is to create unit tests.

By the end of this learning path, you will have built components that are easy to understand, debug, and can be used across different applications.

This learning path includes content from the following Packt products:
* [Learn Python Programming - Second Edition by Fabrizio Romano](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learn-python-programming-second-edition)
* [Python Data Structures and Algorithms by Benjamin Baka](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/python-data-structures-and-algorithms)
* [Python 3 Object-Oriented Programming by Dusty Phillips](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/python-3-object-oriented-programming-third-edition)

## Who this book is for
If you are relatively new to coding and want to write scripts or programs to accomplish tasks using Python, or if you are an object-oriented programmer for other languages and seeking a leg up in the world of Python, then this learning path is for you. Though not essential, it will help you to have basic knowledge of programming and OOP.

## To get the most out of this book
The code in this book will require you to run Python 2.7.x or higher. Python's default interactive environment can also be used to run the snippets of code. Some of the examples in this book rely on third-party libraries that do not ship with Python. They are introduced within the book at the time they are used, so you do not need to install them in advance.
